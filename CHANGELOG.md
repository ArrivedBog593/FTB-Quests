## [1802.3.15]

### Added

* Fixed server->client desync with repeatable quests which have multiple rewards

## [1802.3.14]

### Added
* New Item Task property "Only From Task Screen", false by default
  * When true, items can only be submitted via Task Screen, and the "Submit" button is greyed out when clicking the task
* New quest option "Hide Quest Details Until Startable" - when true, quests are visible in the quest tree but can't be opened to view their description or tasks until all dependencies are complete
  * Can be also be set on a per-chapter basis (true or false)
  * Quests use the chapter setting by default, chapter setting is False by default
* Tasks can now be copy/pasted like quests can, using the "Copy ID" context menu entry
  * Can be pasted using the context menu from the "+" add task button in the quest view panel, or as a new quest on the main quest screen

### Fixed
* In flexible mode, quests which have uncompleted depdendcies are now rendered darker (even if their tasks can be progressed)
* Task Screens now only accept items for tasks which are in "Consume Resources" mode
* Fixed chapters with the same name but in different groups overwriting one another when saved to disk

## [1802.3.13]

### Added
* Quest Links can now be configured more independently of the quest they link to
  * They can have their own size and shape now
  * Editing a Quest Link via the "Edit" context menu now pops up a config screen with only the link properties
  * A new "Edit Linked Quest" context menu entry has been added to allow editing of the original quest via the link GUI item

### Fixed
* Fixed changes to Task Screens not being sync'd to nearby players on SMP
* Fixed the "Optional" quest flag not being sync'd correctly to clients
* Fixed Observation task crashing if given a resource location with bad syntax (for block tag and entity type tag observation types)

## [1802.3.12]

### Added

* Made locked quests (which can't be started due to incomplete dependencies) more obvious in the GUI
  * Tooltip text when hovering the button states it's locked
  * The dependency button (left arrow) in the view quest panel now pulses more obviously if the quest is currently locked
* Quest link icon is now shown (top-left) in the view quest panel outside of edit mode too; click it to jump to the original quest
* The view quest panel for quest with links now shows a second link button (top-right); click it to get a context menu of quests which link to this one

### Fixed

* Restored the "Delete" context menu entry for Rewards which went missing in the last release
* Prevent invisible quest buttons from consuming mouse clicks (e.g. when an invisible quest is in the same position as a visible one)
* Fixed dependency lines being drawn to invisible quests (and appearing to end... nowhere)
* Fixed Task Screens allowing item filters to be pulled out of them
* Fixed Task Screens not rendering items when the task has more than one type of item (e.g. when using an "OR" or "Tag" filter)

## [1802.3.11]

### Added
* The currently selected chapter is now marked on the left-hand chapter panel with a small arrowhead
* (Editor mode) Added the ability to copy/paste quests (with or without dependencies) and quest _links_
  * Use the existing "Copy ID" context menu action on a quest
  * When creating new quests, additional paste options will be available if the current clipboard contents is a valid quest ID
  * Quest links may be useful to provide continuity of progression; you can paste a link to an existing quest in a new chapter
* (Editor mode) Added the ability to copy/paste images (new context menu action when right-clicking an image)
* (Editor mode) Cleaned up the context menus for quest objects a little, by moving quick property adjustments into a submenu
  * Existing context menu was getting far too large and unwieldy, for quests in particular
* (Editor mode) Added a new "flexible" progression mode for quests
  * Quests in "Flexible" mode can have their tasks progressed (but not fully completed) even if dependencies are not yet completed, effectively allowing "pre-completion" of quests
  * Progression mode can be set on quests, chapters, or the entire quest book; the mode is inherited from above if set to "Default", which is the case for quests and chapters
  * Default progression mode for the quest book is "Linear" mode, where dependencies must be completed before a quest can be started (i.e. current behaviour)
* (Editor mode) Quest titles can now contain embedded newlines (just put a "\n" sequence in the title text)
  * Useful for very long quest titles which would cause an excessively wide quest view panel
* (Editor mode) When moving one or more quests, "Moving" is displayed in the bottom left of the screen, along with the "<x> selected" message
  * More clearly differentiates selecting quests and moving them, which are similar but different operations

### Fixed
* (Editor mode) Fixed NPE when clicking in certain areas of the quest description text in the view quest panel
* (Editor mode) Fixed NPE after creating a new quest under some circumstances

## [1802.3.10]

### Added
- The Loot Crate Opener is back! Pipe crates in, pipe rewards out.
- Added a feature whereby players can choose to opt out of quest rewards (as an elective challenge)
  - Use the `/ftbquests block_rewards <true|false> [<player-name>]`
  - Reward blocking is by team only
  - This is toggleable by anyone in single-player mode, but admin privileges are required on dedicated server
  - Can be used as a command reward to make repeatable checkmark quests to enable and disable rewards from the quest book, if desired

### Fixes
- Added missing recipes for Task Screens
- Fixed KubeJS version depdendency on Fabric (was rejecting valid up-to-date KubeJS releases)

## [1802.3.9]

### Added
- Task Screens have returned! Task display and automated completion are now possible
  - Item Tasks and Fluid Tasks can be used on both Forge and Fabric
  - Forge Energy Tasks can be used on Forge
  - Tech Reborn Energy Tasks can be used on Fabric
- The left-hand Chapter panel now remembers its pinned status across runs of the game
- When viewing a quest, the dependencies and dependents buttons are now a more visible colour when deps exist
  - In addition, the dependencies button will blink if the current quest can't be started due to an incomplete dependency
- The dependencies and dependents button tooltips now also show the chapter for dependent quests, if they're in a different chapter to the current one
- Selecting a quest outside edit mode (with either right or left-click) will preview any hidden dependents
  - Dependency lines and quest box outlines will be shown, but no other information; so the player at least knows that follow-on quest(s) exist

#### For content creators
- Edit mode can now be toggled from within the Quests GUI (new button in bottom right)
  - In an SSP world, you will require "Allow Cheats: ON" to be able to see this button
- Multiple quests can now be selected (for moving/deletion/etc.) by dragging a box with the middle mouse button
  - Hold Control to toggle selected status of quests
- The Structure Task now supports structure tags (e.g. `#minecraft:villages` will match any village)
- Added a `/ftbquests reload` command to reload quest data from file. Requires user to be in editing mode
  - Caution: not recommended for use on live servers. Take care when editing quest file data directly. Make a backup!
- Added a "Save to Server" button in the settings context menu which allows quest data to be saved immediately
  - Quest data is normally saved with a world-save, but this is a convenience to allow quest developers to save without leaving the GUI
- When in editing mode, hidden quests which would be invisible outside editing mode now have an "eye" icon to indicate that
- Quest title, subtitle and description text now supports vanilla-style raw JSON text (https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_JSON_text_format)
  - Standard markup (colour, bold, etc.) is supported, in addition to `clickEvent` and `hoverEvent` (click & hover events only function in subtitle and description text, not the title)
  - Any line starting with `{` or `[` followed by 0 or more whitespace followed by `"` will be treated as raw JSON text, e.g. `{ "text": "hello", "color": "green" }` or `["hello ", {"text":"world", "color":"yellow"}]`
  - The `change_page` action (normally only used in vanilla books) can be used in quest text to switch the quest view to another chapter, quest, or task. Use the long hex ID for the object you want to switch to; the ID for any object can be grabbed via the "Copy ID" context menu action
  - Old-style markup (previously used by FTB Quests) is still supported for brevity (that is, lines which start with `{`, e.g. `{my.translation.key}`)
- Added quick-edit hotkeys to the quest view popup
  - "T" edits the quest title
  - "S" edits the quest subtitle
  - "D" edits the quest description
  - Old-style markup (previously used by FTB Quests) is still supported for brevity (that is, lines which start with `{`, e.g. `{my.translation.key}`)
- Added an entity type tag `ftbquests:no_loot_crates`; any entity in this tag will never drop a loot crate on death
- Quest view minimum width config setting now also has a chapter default setting (thanks @MasterOfBob777/@DarkMega18)
- Quests now have an "Invisible" setting; if true, the quests is hidden until completed (thanks @MasterOfBob777/@DarkMega18)
  - There's a related "Invisible until X tasks completed" setting which allows the quest to appear after one or more tasks have been completed
- Quests now have a "Repeatable" setting again; the quest will reset and be available once more after any rewards are claimed (thanks @MasterOfBob777/@DarkMega18)
- Quests now have an "Exclude from Claim All" setting which allows them to ignore the "Claim All" button (thanks @MasterOfBob777/@DarkMega18)
  - May be useful for quests which have some kind of special non-item reward (e.g. running a command) which is more suitable for clicking directly
- Item Tasks have two new settings in the config screen: "Match NBT" and "Weak NBT Matching"
  - "Match NBT" is a tristate: Default means to use the current behaviour; items must be in the `itemfilters:check_nbt` tag, False means to never try NBT matching, and True means to always try NBT matching.
  - "Weak NBT Matching" is a boolean; when true, only top-level NBT fields in the filter item will be matched (so if the item being checked has extra NBT data, it will still match)
- The Location Task config screen has had tooltips added to the X/Y/Z entries to clearly explain how they are interpreted in conjunction with the W/H/D entries
- The outline colors for locked quests and unlocked-but-unstarted quests are now themable via the `ftb_quests_theme.txt` resource pack file (previously these quest types were hardcoded to grey and white outlines, respectively)

### Fixed
- Fixed an NPE in the Stats Task if the resource location is unknown
- The Location Task config screen has had tooltips added to the X/Y/Z entries to clearly explain how they are interpreted in conjunction with the W/H/D entries)
- The focused grid position (where a quest would be added) is now highlighted again
- Pressing Escape in various screens now goes back to the previous screen instead of closing the entire GUI
  - Similarly, pressing Escape when viewing a quest pops down the quest view, and when a context menu is popped up, that will be popped down
- Full JEI support has returned for quests (items -> rewards) and loot crates (reward table -> list of reward items and their weights)
- The quest auto-pin button now works again to display progress of all available quests
- Fixed item durability bars in quest buttons rendering over the chapter panel
- Fixed Dimension Tasks triggering even when dependencies weren't met
- Fixed the quest completion notification icon being missing from the quest book sidebar button when using REI instead of JEI

#### For content creators
- The Checkmark Task config screen no longer allows editing of the icon (checkmark tasks always just display a tickbox, so it wasn't useful)
- The focused grid position (where a quest would be added) is now highlighted again
- Fixed garbled text when confirming deletion of multiple quests
- Clicking a greyed out item in a context menu no longer closes the menu
- Fixed certain context menu items crashing the client when clicked
- Fixed quest-specific (i.e. the long hex quest ID) theme data not being loaded from `ftb_quests_theme.txt` (note this file can be overridden in resource packs) 
- Better behaviour for the multiline text editor used to edit quest description paragraphs (right click quest -> Edit -> Description)
- Fixed Reward Table editing screen shrinking every time it was reopened when adding/deleting entries
